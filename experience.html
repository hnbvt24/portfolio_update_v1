        <h2>Projects</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>As a member of BCM at Virginia Tech, I helped the BCM update their website by creating a new design. The old site was out-dated and was not continually updated. So I took on the task of becoming the webmaster for the sight and scrapping the old design and creating an entirely new template that would make students want to visit it time after time. It is more up-to-date on information and has a friendlier user-interface that makes finding information easier.</li>
          <li>Designed and developed an E-commerce website using HTML, CSS, Javascript, jQuery, and web design best practices for an Independent Study Research. I designed a fictitious bake-shop called “Sweet Treats” where a customer could buy cookies, bread, cupcakes, and more via their online store. This site was inspired by my love for baking and my desire to learn how to create an online shopping experience. The site does not actually sell any products, it is purely for research only.</li>
